# MadboxTest

- The time it took you to perform the exercise

It took me almost the 5 hours to make the test with 2 levels and a simple main screen.
  
- The parts that were difficult for you and why

Maybe the hardest part were adjust the levels to make them doable, at first were imposible to win...

- The parts you think you could do better and how

Probably some refactor to make the code more organized.

Maybe use DOTS to make sure that the game performs nice (the has good performance on editor and on my device although).

Better level design.

- What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

In this case more levels with new mechanics.

Better art (I've zero art skills)

With more time I could make some music for the game (I've some music production skills)

- What did you think

Make this test have been so much fun, I've learned somethings that I've not used before like Cinemachine.
